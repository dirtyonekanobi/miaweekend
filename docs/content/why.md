{{<figure class="image main" src="images/mia1.png">}} Why have an appreciation weekend?  ...well, have you seen yourself?  You stop traffic!  Seriously though - I know how much you do for Bella and I.  I love you intensely, immensely, and unconditionally...for this, and many other reasons.  I don't always properly show you that appreciation.  I don't always properly convey to you just how much you mean to me, and just how thankful I truly am to have you as a wife and friend.  You are my rhyme, my reason; my tides, my season; my wife, my life; my friend ...forever. I love you. ...hopefully this weekend I can show you just how much
